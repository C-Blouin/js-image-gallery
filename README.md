# js-image-gallery


A JavaScript Application that revolves around changing the image source and text content dependent on the clicked thumbnail image within the gallery. I built this during my second semester at Georgian College to build upon my understanding of JavaScript concepts. The gallery was designed for desktop view only and I will likely revisit making layout adjustments to allow all screen sizes to render correctly without issues.
